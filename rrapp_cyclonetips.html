    </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>WHEN A CYCLONE WARNING IS ISSUED</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Depending on official advice provided by your local authorities as the event evolves; the following actions may be warranted.</li> 
    <li>If requested by local authorities, collect children from school or childcare centre and go home.</li> 
    <li>Park vehicles under solid shelter (hand brake on and in gear).</li> 
    <li>Put wooden or plastic outdoor furniture in your pool or inside with other loose items.</li> 
    <li>Close shutters or board-up or heavily tape all windows. Draw curtains and lock doors.</li> 
    <li>Pack an evacuation kit of warm clothes, essential medications, baby formula, nappies,
    valuables, important papers, photos and mementos in waterproof bags to be taken with
    your emergency kit. Large/heavy valuables could be protected in a strong cupboard.</li> 
    <li>Remain indoors (with your pets). Stay tuned to your local radio/TV for further information.</li> 
    </ol>
    <div>
    <h3>ON WARNING OF LOCAL EVACUATION</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Based on predicted wind speeds and storm surge heights, evacuation may be necessary.</li> 
    <li>Official advice will be given on local radio/TV regarding safe routes and when to move.</li>    
    <li>Wear strong shoes (not things) and tough clothing for protection.</li> 
    <li>Lock doors; turn off power, gas, and water; take your evacuation and emergency kits.</li> 
    <li>If evacuating inland (out of town), take pets and leave early to avoid heavy traffic, flooding and wind hazards.</li> 
    <li>If evacuating to a public shelter or higher location, follow police and State/Territory Emergency Services directions.</li> 
    <li>If going to a public shelter, take bedding needs and books or games for children.</li> 
    <li> Leave pets protected and with food and water.</li> 
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>WHEN THE CYCLONE STRIKES</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Disconnect all electrical appliances. Listen to your battery radio for updates.</li> 
    <li>Stay inside and shelter (well clear of windows) in the strongest part of the building,
    i.e. cellar, internal hallway or bathroom. Keep evacuation and emergency kits with you.</li> 
    <li>If the building starts to break up, protect yourself with mattresses, rugs or blankets under a
    strong table or bench or hold onto a solid fixture, e.g. a water pipe.</li> 
    <li>Beware the calm 'eye'. If the wind drops, don't assume the cyclone is over; violent winds
    will soon resume from another direction. Wait for the official 'all clear'.</li>    
    <li>If driving, stop (handbrake on and in gear) â€” but well away from the sea and clear of trees,
    power lines and streams. Stay in the vehicle.</li> 
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>AFTER THE CYCLONE</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Don't go outside until officially advised it is safe.</li> 
    <li>Check for gas leaks. Don't use electric appliances if wet.</li> 
    <li>Listen to local radio for official warnings and advice.</li> 
    <li>If you have to evacuate, or did so earlier, don't return until advised. Use a recommended route and don't rush.</li> 
    <li>Beware of damaged power lines, bridges, buildings, trees, and don't enter floodwaters.</li> 
    <li>Heed all warnings and don't go sightseeing. Check/help neighbours instead.</li> 
    </li>Don't make unnecessary telephone calls.</li> 
    </ol>
