            <h3>Preparing for a Flood</h3>
            <ol>
            <li><h4>Know Your Risk for Floods</h4>
            Visit FEMA's Flood Map Service Center to know types of flood risk in your area.  Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.</li>
            <li><h4>Purchase Flood Insurance</h4>
            Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. Homeowner’s insurance policies do not cover flooding. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect so the time to buy is well before a disaster. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</li>
            <li><h4>Preparing for a Flood</h4>
            Make a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area.</li>
            <li><h4>In Case of Emergency</h4>
            Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies. Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a sump pump with a battery.</li>

            <li>Evacuate immediately, if told to evacuate.</li> 
            <li>Never drive around barricades.</li>

            <li>Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown!</li>
            <li>Stay off bridges over fast-moving water.</li> 
            <li>Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.</li>
            <li>Stay inside your car if it is trapped in rapidly moving water. Get on the roof if water is rising inside the car.</li>
            <li>Get to the highest level if trapped in a building. Only get on the roof if necessary and once there signal for help. Do not climb into a closed attic to avoid getting trapped by rising floodwater.</li>
